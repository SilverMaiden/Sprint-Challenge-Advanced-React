- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    Without hooks, class components give you control over the lifecycle of a component.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    On mount: To do something when the component first mounts,
    Updating: Refreshing whenever the state of the component changes
    On unmount: To do something when the component unmounts.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    To allow us to compose and share non-visual logic and behaviour.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    Tests allow us to safely explore the functionality (or lack thereof) of our app
    in a controlled manner, that will not result in breaking things.
